<h3>🎯 Goal of the Day</h3>

The goal of Day 01 is to build a strong mental model of Java before jumping into syntax or coding.

Today focuses on:

What Java really is (beyond definitions)

Why Java is platform-independent

Understanding JVM, JRE, and JDK

How Java code actually runs behind the scenes

📌 This day removes confusion that causes many candidates to fail basic interview questions.

---
<h3>🧠 Concepts Introduced</h3>

Java Fundamentals

What Java is and where it is used

Features of Java (OOP, portability, security)

Why Java is still relevant in MNCs

JVM, JRE & JDK

JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

JDK (Java Development Kit)

Clear differences (no mugging)

Java Execution Flow

.java → .class

Role of compiler & JVM

Bytecode concept

📌 Detailed explanations, diagrams, and examples are covered in notes.md

📌 Why This Topic Matters in Interviews

This is one of the most frequently asked areas in Java interviews.

Interviewers ask this to check:

Your fundamental clarity

Whether you actually understand Java or just write code

Your ability to explain concepts clearly

🧠 Many candidates lose confidence here — mastering this gives you an early edge.

Commonly asked in:

TCS, Infosys, Wipro

Capgemini, Accenture

Amazon, Flipkart (as warm-up questions)

<h3>🧩 How Java Code Executes</h3>

A simplified view of what happens when you run Java code:

Developer writes .java file

Java Compiler converts it into bytecode

JVM loads the bytecode

JVM executes it on the current OS

This execution model is the reason Java is platform-independent.

📌 Execution flow with JVM internals is explained step-by-step in notes.md.

---
<h3>📝 Notes & Learning Approach</h3>

For Day 01, the focus is on:

Concept clarity over memorization

Simple language → interview-ready explanations

Beginner friendly → MNC acceptable depth

👉 If you can explain Day 01 confidently, your Java base is solid.

---

<h3>💡 Key Takeaways</h3>

Java is more than just a programming language

JVM is the heart of Java’s power

Platform independence is not magic — it’s design

Strong fundamentals reduce fear in interviews

<h3>🎯 Interview Preparation (Day 01 Level)</h3>

Q1. What is Java?
Java is an object-oriented, platform-independent programming language used to build scalable applications.

Q2. What is JVM?
JVM is a virtual machine that executes Java bytecode and enables platform independence.

Q3. Difference between JVM, JRE, and JDK?
JVM runs the program, JRE provides runtime environment, and JDK is used for development.

Q4. Why is Java platform independent?
Because Java code is compiled into bytecode which can run on any system having a JVM.

📌 Easy, Medium, and Tricky versions of these questions are covered in notes.md.
