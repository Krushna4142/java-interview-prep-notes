## 🎯 Goal of the Day

The goal of **Day 02** is to understand the **Client–Server Architecture**, which is the **foundation of all backend systems**.

This day focuses on:

- Understanding client and server responsibilities
- Learning request–response flow
- Seeing how Java backend fits into real systems
- Preparing system-design basics for interviews

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

By the end of this day, you will clearly understand:

- What client–server architecture is
- Difference between client, server, and database
- How frontend communicates with backend
- How Java backend applications act as servers

📌 Detailed explanations and interview notes are available in **notes.md**.

---

## 📌 Why This Topic Matters

Client–Server Architecture is asked in:

- Backend interviews
- System design rounds (basic)
- Java / Spring Boot discussions

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

Basic communication model:

Client → Request → Server  
Client ← Response ← Server

- Client handles UI and user interaction
- Server handles logic and data
- Database is accessed only by the server

This architecture is the **base of web applications, mobile apps, and APIs**.

---

## 🎯 Interview Preparation (Day 02)

You should be able to answer:

- What is client–server architecture?
- What is the role of client and server?
- Where does Java backend fit?
- Why client should not access database directly?

📌 All answers are structured in **notes.md**.
