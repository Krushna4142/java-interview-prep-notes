## 🎯 Goal of the Day

The goal of **Day 05** is to understand how to design:

- Clean REST APIs
- Professional URL structures
- Industry-standard backend endpoints

This day focuses on:

- REST naming conventions
- Proper HTTP method usage
- Resource-based URL design
- Clean and scalable API structure

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

By the end of this day, you will clearly understand:

- How to name REST endpoints properly
- Difference between good and bad API design
- How to structure URLs professionally
- REST best practices used in real companies
- How Spring Boot follows REST standards

📌 Detailed explanations and interview notes are available in **notes.md**.

## 📌 Why This Topic Matters

REST API design is asked in:

- Java backend interviews
- Spring Boot interviews
- System design rounds
- Real-world project discussions

Interviewers use this topic to test:

- Your backend maturity

## 🧩 REST Design Principles

Professional REST APIs follow:

- Use nouns, not verbs in URLs
- Use plural resource names
- Use correct HTTP methods
- Maintain statelessness
- Return proper HTTP status codes

Example:

GET /users  
POST /users  
GET /users/101  
PUT /users/101  
DELETE /users/101

Bad Example:

GET /getAllUsers  
POST /createUser

REST prefers resource-based structure.

- What are REST best practices?
- Why should URLs use nouns?
- Why plural resource names are preferred?
- What is idempotency in REST?
- Difference between PUT and PATCH?
- What makes an API scalable?

📌 All answers are structured in **notes.md**.
