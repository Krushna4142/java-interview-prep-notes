- Microservices architecture
- Their differences
- When to use which architecture

This day focuses on:

- Scalability concepts
- Deployment strategies
- Real-world backend system design
- Interview-level architecture clarity

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

By the end of this day, you will clearly understand:

- What is Monolithic architecture?
- What is Microservices architecture?
- Advantages and disadvantages of both
- Scalability differences
- How modern backend systems are structured

📌 Detailed explanations and interview notes are available in **notes.md**.

---

## 📌 Why This Topic Matters

Architecture comparison is asked in:

- Backend interviews

## 🏗 Architecture Comparison

Monolithic Architecture:

- Single codebase
- Single deployment unit
- Shared database
- Tightly coupled modules

Microservices Architecture:

- Multiple independent services
- Separate deployments
- Independent databases
- Loosely coupled services

Key Difference:

Monolith → Simpler to start  
Microservices → Better for scalability
