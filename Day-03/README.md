## 🎯 Goal of the Day

The goal of **Day 03** is to understand **how clients and servers communicate** using:

- HTTP protocol
- REST principles

This day focuses on:

- Understanding HTTP request–response model
- Learning common HTTP methods
- Understanding REST architecture
- Seeing how Java backend uses REST APIs

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

By the end of this day, you will clearly understand:

- What HTTP protocol is
- How HTTP request and response work
- Purpose of HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
- What REST is and why it is used
- How Java backend exposes REST APIs

📌 Detailed explanations and interview notes are available in **notes.md**.

---

## 📌 Why This Topic Matters

HTTP and REST are asked in:

- Java backend interviews
- Spring Boot interviews
- Full-stack interviews
- API and system design discussions

Interviewers use this topic to test:

- Backend communication clarity
- API design understanding
- Real-world backend experience

## 🔄 Communication Flow

Basic backend communication:

Client → HTTP Request → Server  
Client ← HTTP Response ← Server

- HTTP defines communication rules
- REST defines how APIs should be structured
- Java backend acts as REST API provider

This flow is the **core of modern backend systems**.

---

## 🎯 Interview Preparation (Day 03)

You should be able to answer:

- What is HTTP?
- Why is HTTP stateless?
- What are common HTTP methods?
- What is REST?
- Difference between HTTP and REST?
- How Java backend uses REST APIs?

📌 All answers are structured in **notes.md**.
